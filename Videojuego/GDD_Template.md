## _Game Design_

---

### **Summary**

Sum up your game idea in 2 sentences. A kind of elevator pitch. Keep it simple!

### **Gameplay**

What should the gameplay be like? What is the goal of the game, and what kind of obstacles are in the way? What tactics should the player use to overcome them?

### **Mindset**

What kind of mindset do you want to provoke in the player? Do you want them to feel powerful, or weak? Adventurous, or nervous? Hurried, or calm? How do you intend to provoke those emotions?

## _Technical_

---

### **Screens**

1. Title Screen
    1. Options
2. Level Select
3. Game
    1. Inventory
    2. Assessment / Next Level
4. End Credits

_(example)_

### **Controls**

How will the player interact with the game? Will they be able to choose the controls? What kind of in-game events are they going to be able to trigger, and how? (e.g. pressing buttons, opening doors, etc.)

### **Mechanics**

Are there any interesting mechanics? If so, how are you going to accomplish them? Physics, algorithms, etc.

## _Level Design_

_(Note : These sections can safely be skipped if they&#39;re not relevant, or you&#39;d rather go about it another way. For most games, at least one of them should be useful. But I&#39;ll understand if you don&#39;t want to use them. It&#39;ll only hurt my feelings a little bit.)_

    1. Mood

4. Player encounters castle - door&#39;s shut and locked
5. There&#39;s a window within jump height, and a rock on the ground
6. Player picks up rock and throws at glass (&quot;throw&quot; taught)
7. â€¦ etc.

## _Graphics_

---

### **Style Attributes**

What kinds of colors will you be using? Do you have a limited palette to work with? A post-processed HSV map/image? Consistency is key for immersion.

What kind of graphic style are you going for? Cartoony? Pixel-y? Cute? How, specifically? Solid, thick outlines with flat hues? Non-black outlines with limited tints/shades? Emphasize smooth curvatures over sharp angles? Describe a set of general rules depicting your style here.

Well-designed feedback, both good (e.g. leveling up) and bad (e.g. being hit), are great for teaching the player how to play through trial and error, instead of scripting a lengthy tutorial. What kind of visual feedback are you going to use to let the player know they&#39;re interacting with something? That they \*can\* interact with something?

### **Graphics Needed**

1. Characters
    1. Human-like
        1. Goblin (idle, walking, throwing)
        2. Guard (idle, walking, stabbing)
        3. Prisoner (walking, running)
    2. Other
        1. Wolf (idle, walking, running)
        2. Giant Rat (idle, scurrying)
2. Blocks
    1. Dirt
    2. Dirt/Grass
    3. Stone Block
    4. Stone Bricks
    5. Tiled Floor
    6. Weathered Stone Block
    7. Weathered Stone Bricks
3. Ambient
    1. Tall Grass
    2. Rodent (idle, scurrying)
    3. Torch
    4. Armored Suit
    5. Chains (matching Weathered Stone Bricks)
    6. Blood stains (matching Weathered Stone Bricks)
4. Other
    1. Chest
    2. Door (matching Stone Bricks)
    3. Gate
    4. Button (matching Weathered Stone Bricks)

_(example)_


## _Sounds/Music_

---

### **Style Attributes**

Again, consistency is key. Define that consistency here. What kind of instruments do you want to use in your music? Any particular tempo, key? Influences, genre? Mood?

Stylistically, what kind of sound effects are you looking for? Do you want to exaggerate actions with lengthy, cartoony sounds (e.g. mario&#39;s jump), or use just enough to let the player know something happened (e.g. mega man&#39;s landing)? Going for realism? You can use the music style as a bit of a reference too.

 Remember, auditory feedback should stand out from the music and other sound effects so the player hears it well. Volume, panning, and frequency/pitch are all important aspects to consider in both music _and_ sounds - so plan accordingly!

### **Sounds Needed**

1. Effects
    1. Soft Footsteps (dirt floor)
    2. Sharper Footsteps (stone floor)
    3. Soft Landing (low vertical velocity)
    4. Hard Landing (high vertical velocity)
    5. Glass Breaking
    6. Chest Opening
    7. Door Opening
2. Feedback
    1. Relieved &quot;Ahhhh!&quot; (health)
    2. Shocked &quot;Ooomph!&quot; (attacked)
    3. Happy chime (extra life)
    4. Sad chime (died)

_(example)_

### **Music Needed**

1. Slow-paced, nerve-racking &quot;forest&quot; track
2. Exciting &quot;castle&quot; track
3. Creepy, slow &quot;dungeon&quot; track
4. Happy ending credits track
5. Rick Astley&#39;s hit #1 single &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;

_(example)_
