Attrition card game, where the player's main goal is to hold back the waves of 
endless enemies who are bound to destroy the space-time continium, and the 
player must spend their khronos resource to play unit and paradox cards, and 
hold out as long as they can with a deck that gets thinner every turn, until 
they eventually run out, and the player must make their last stand.

This game is a turn based, Single Player Versus Environment (PVE) card game, 
which uses a Standard Query Language (SQL) database to store all relevant game 
information, and through a NodeJS and Express server Application Programming 
Interface (API), allows the game to interact with the database as needed.

## Game

The game itself is developed using the Unity Game Engine.

## Data Base

The SQL interface is managed using MySQL and PostgreSQL Data Base Management 
Systems (DBMS's).

## Web App

The web application is hosted using NodeJS and Express, which is in charge of 
the API interaction between the web app, the unity game engine, and the SQL 
data base.
